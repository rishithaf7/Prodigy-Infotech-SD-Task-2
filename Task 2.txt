How It Works:
Random Number Generation: The program generates a random number between 1 and 100 using random.randint(1, 100).

Guess Loop: It enters a loop where it repeatedly prompts the user for their guess until the correct number is guessed.

Feedback and Counting: For each guess, the program provides feedback on whether the guess is too high or too low. It also keeps track of the number of attempts.

Handling Invalid Input: If the user inputs something that isn't a number, the program catches the ValueError and prompts the user to enter a valid number.

End of Game: When the user guesses the number correctly, the program exits the loop and displays the number of attempts.
